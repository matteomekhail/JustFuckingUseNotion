    <h1>Just fucking use <a href={notionUrl} target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notion</a></h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Still watching 47 YouTube videos about "My PERFECT Productivity System"?
      Still comparing apps like it's your goddamn PhD thesis?
      <strong>Cut the crap. Use Notion. Move the fuck on.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>"But Apple Notes is free and already on my iPhone!"</h2>
    <p>
      Oh yeah? So is a paper napkin, dipshit. Apple Notes is the digital equivalent of scribbling on bar napkins.
      It's fine for your grocery list. It's fine for "remind me to call mom".
      But if you're trying to organize your life, your projects, or anything more complex than "buy milk",
      Apple Notes will stare at you with those empty pre-installed app eyes and say: <em>"Bro, I wasn't built for this shit."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Want to create a database? Nope. Want to link your notes together? Nope. Want a Kanban view? What the fuck is a Kanban, says Apple Notes.
      Want to collaborate with your team? Sure, you can share a note like it's 2008 and we're still using carrier pigeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple Notes is that thing you use when you don't know better options exist. It's the McDonald's of note-taking apps:
      you find it everywhere, it's not terrible when you're desperate, but it's not exactly a culinary experience.
    </p>

    <h2>"What about Obsidian? I heard it's super cool!"</h2>
    <p>
      Okay, hold up. Obsidian is a serious product. It's powerful. It's for people who know what they're doing.
      <strong>But it's a completely different thing.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Obsidian is for those who want to build a "second brain" with local Markdown files,
      bidirectional links, graph views that look like conspiracy theory maps,
      and plugins for every imaginable bullshit. It's beautiful. It's nerdy. It's for those who want total control.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here's the thing: <strong>Obsidian is a solo tool.</strong> It's designed for one person's brain, not for teams.
      You want to collaborate with your coworkers? Share a project with your team? Build a company wiki?
      Good fucking luck syncing those Markdown files across 10 people without merge conflicts and existential dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notion was built for collaboration from day one. Real-time editing, comments, permissions, team workspaces,
      shared databases, the whole damn pipeline. Your designer, your developer, your PM, and that one asshole who never reads anything
      can all work in the same space without losing their fucking minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obsidian is the Linux of note-taking apps: powerful, customizable, fantastic if you have time, energy, and work alone.
      Notion is the "it just works" for teams and individuals who want to be productive
      <em>today</em>, not in six months when you've finally figured out how to sync your vault across devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      (And honestly, if you're a true Obsidian enjoyer, you're probably not on this site anyway.
      You're busy configuring your 47th plugin for daily journaling with dynamic templates.
      I respect that. But we're not the same person.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and to all you smug bastards who reply "jUsT fUcKiNg UsE oBsIdIaN" every time someone has a Notion question:
      <strong>shut the fuck up.</strong> Nobody asked. That's like telling someone who wants a car to just build a motorcycle from scratch.
      Go back to your terminal and leave the rest of us alone.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>So why the fuck should I use Notion?</h2>
    <p>
      Because Notion does everything. Databases, notes, wikis, project management, calendars,
      to-do lists, documentation, CRM if you want, and even a fucking website if you feel like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Want a Kanban? You got it. A table? You got it. A calendar linked to your tasks? You fucking got it.
      Want to view the same data in 5 different ways? Guess what. <strong>You. Got. It.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      And the beautiful thing? You don't need to be a damn programmer. You don't need to watch 14 hours of tutorials.
      Open Notion, write, drag, organize. It just fucking works.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>"But it's complicated!"</h2>
    <p>
      No, <em>you're</em> making it complicated. Stop looking for the perfect template.
      Stop watching setups from people who use Notion as a full-time job.
      Open a blank page and start writing. Add a table if you need one.
      A database if you need one. Otherwise, just fucking write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfection is the enemy of getting shit done. Your "perfect system" doesn't exist and never will.
      Only the one you actually use matters. And Notion is flexible enough to adapt to your ass,
      not the other way around.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>"Is the free plan enough?"</h2>
    <p>
      For most people? Hell yes. Notion's free plan is generous as fuck.
      Unlimited pages, unlimited blocks. You only pay if you want advanced team features or extra storage.
      It's not like those greedy bastard apps that give you 3 free notes and then "PAY $15/MONTH TO UNLOCK THE COLOR BLUE".
